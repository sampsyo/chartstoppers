This week: well, it exists. Eric and Adrian splash around in the swampy pop-culture more-ass left behind by box-office hit [Fifty Shades of Grey](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2322441/). Ed Sheeran and the jerks in Maroon 5 proffer some well-timed wedding fodder. Adrian waves a long goodbye to Bruno Mars's goatee while his limo goes slower than anything has any right to go, and we all find out exactly which blazers Eric has.
