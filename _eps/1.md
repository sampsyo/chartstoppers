On this inaugural episode of *Chartstoppers,* Eric and Adrian grapple with the pronunciation of Ariana Grande's name, the freaky old-person/cop/chubby-kid trope of modern music videos, and the travesty of Shitty MAGIC! Man. Along the way from #5 to #1 on this week's charts, they take a brief detour to wiggle wiggle wiggle (they do, in fact, know what to do with that big, fat butt).

* 5: Iggy Azalea feat. Charli XCX --- Fancy
* 4: Ariana Grande feat. Zedd --- Break Free
* 3: Sam Smith --- Stay With Me
* 2: Meghan Trainor --- All About That Bass
* Detour: Jason Derulo feat. Snoop Dogg --- Wiggle
* 1: MAGIC! --- Rude
