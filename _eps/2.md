Eric and Adrian return briefly to the poisoned MAGIC! well along the leisurely walk from Nico & Vinz up through Nicki & Swift. Adrian gets a little paranoid about shadowy studio executives; Eric gets a little hungry for a fruit salad. And this week's detour leads them to wax sentimental over Charli XCX.

* 9: Jessie J, Ariana Grande & Nicki Minaj — Bang Bang
* 8: Sia — Chandelier
* 6: Iggy Azalea feat. Rita Ora — Black Widow
* 2: Nicki Minaj — Anaconda
* Detour: Charli XCX — Boom Clap
* 1: Taylor Swift — Shake It Off
